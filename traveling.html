        <h2>Piirita beach, Estonia</h2>
        <p>This photo was taken during a Kizomba party at the beach in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>
        <p>One of the best places to spend the summer is the north of Europe as there ia a very pleasant wheather and since there is sun outside there is a lot of life in the city compared to winter </p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="images/rsz_rila.jpg" class ="center_image" alt="Rila lakes, Bulgaria">
        <h2>Rila lakes, Bulgaria</h2>
        <p>Rila lakes are a set  of 7 lakes located on the Rila mountain at more than 2000 meter over the sea level.</p>
        <p>In order to get to see all the lakes you need to hike for around 4 hours. DonÂ´t forget also the two hours drive from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, to the Rila mountain; but it is totally worth it! </p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="images/rsz_atenas.jpg" class ="center_image" alt="Athenas, Greece">  
        <h2>Athenas, Greece</h2>
        <p>This city can present by itself. The capital of Greece is a place with endless history on it. From the ancient greek culture, the Bizantine Era, all the way to our modern Oympic events.</p>
        <p>The only downside about this amazing place is the huge amount of tourist that you will find. Also mind the temperatures that you will find in summer as it can get very hot.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="images/rsz_mtskheta.jpg" class ="center_image" alt="Mtskheta, Georgia">
        <h2>Mtskheta, Georgia</h2>
        <p>Perhaps not one of the most popular countries in Europe but Georgia hides many beautiful scenaries all around its territory. From ancient castles all the way to incredible mountains and cities.</p>
        <p>The Georgian territory and people are very welcoming, you can surely ask for a tip or help from an stranger in the streets. Another positive thing is that it is a cheap country and there are many different landscapes, you can find cities, beach and sea, an mountanous places.</p>
